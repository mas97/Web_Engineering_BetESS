# Web_Engineering_BetESS
University project developed for the course of Web Engineering. In this project, the team developed, through a whole semester, a web platform for BetESS, an already existing project made by the same team. The main goal of our web platform is to provide a good and decent interface for the user to be able to play and bet against other players, and make money (not real money).
